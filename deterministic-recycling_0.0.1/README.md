This mod is the result of me being annoyed that my upcycling set up got clogged up. Because ya know random chance sucks.

So I added a Deterministic Recycler to resolve this issue. It takes in 4 times the ingredients, so it can spit out exactly the items needed for another craft.
Avoiding Softlocks of not getting enough of Resource B while having Resource A on mass.

todo:
- Settings to have this Behaviour in the default recycler and not the dedicated one.
- make recipes that output more than 1 work. (Congrete, Artificial soil, ...).

Known issues:
- Recipes not showing in Recycling recipes in the Factoriopedia.
